1. A gaussian linear regression model that can compute where it is most likely to encounter kontrollanter.
or can a graph neural network do this?
2. A multivariate linear regression model that can compute the difficulty of a discgolf course

3. A RNN LSTM that can predict timeseries, especially financial timeseries.
4. A transformer that can predict macrotrends in economics
5. A RNN sentiment analyser pulling data from twitter/X.

reinforecement learning:
6. Something involving a deep q-learning network and robotics, maybe a maze solver or something. 
7. REINFORCE (Monte Carlo Policy Gradient) - portfolio management
8. Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)
9. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
10. AlphaZero (Monte Carlo Tree Search + Deep Learning)
